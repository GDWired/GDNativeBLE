# GDNativeBLE
Implementation of NativeBLE (Bluetooth Low Energy library) in GDNative

A BLE device such as the ESP32 is needed to run the godot project, the program used in the ESP32 is in the esp32 folder (tested on PlatformIO only)

The BLE library used in this project is deprecated (https://github.com/kdewald/nativeble), this project exists just for fun. I have also implemented the library SimpleBLE (https://github.com/OpenBluetoothToolbox/SimpleBLE) you can find the source code here (https://github.com/GDWired/GDSimpleBLE).

Works only on macOS but should work on other platfroms.
